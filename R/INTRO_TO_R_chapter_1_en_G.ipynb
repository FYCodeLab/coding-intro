        "R is a language widely used in research. It is particularly well-suited for mathematics, statistics, and data analysis because it is powerful and very fast. Plus, it isn‚Äôt too difficult to get started with.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **A Little History**\n",
        "\n",
        "R was created by [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)) as a programming language intended for teaching introductory statistics. The project began in 1993 at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Why the name R? It‚Äôs simple: R is based on another language called [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) (and no, I haven‚Äôt looked into why that one was called S).\n",
        "\n",
        "This programming language is now very widespread and has given millions of professionals‚Äîin both academia and industry‚Äîaccess to an open‚Äêsource language that is both simple and powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "In biology, [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) are the most frequently used languages. Here, we will explore the main commands of R and let you have a little fun. In doing so, you will experience the joy of programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What to Do With Your Code?**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to write a document, there are several programs available, but you will probably prefer to use Word. Similarly, if you want to code in R, the simplest option is to use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). It is free and easy to use. This type of software is called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which simply means a program that lets you write and execute code.\n",
        "For this brief introductory course‚Äîand for simplicity‚Äôs sake‚ÄîI will not ask you to install RStudio. Instead, we will use another IDE that is online, called Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What Is Google Colab?**\n",
        "I mention this digression because Google Colab is a tool that is both extremely simple and extremely powerful, available to everyone for free.\n",
        "[Google Colab](https://medium.com/kainos-applied-innovation/how-google-has-crushed-it-with-colaboratory-5664b5fb5856) was created in 2017 and provides everyone with a simple environment in which to run Python and R code. It is an online tool, so the computations are not performed on your computer but on Google‚Äôs servers (these remote computers in the cloud are called servers). The servers provided free by Google are much more powerful and faster, allowing you to perform extremely long and complex tasks without having to purchase a supercomputer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab is an IDE (a program for executing code). It is somewhat unusual because it takes the form of a **notebook**. In computing, a notebook refers to an IDE that resembles a web page rather than the stereotypical hacker‚Äôs black screen. This way of presenting code‚Äîin sequential cells immediately followed by their output‚Äîis ideal for learning programming and for scientific use. Notebooks were popularized in 2014 thanks to the [Jupyter Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), and Google Colab is an excellent example; we will use it today for this introduction.\n",
